# BertinK_portofolio
This is a sample portofolio showing my work experience to a potential employer.
On the page I show a recent photo and links to differents sections of my work and how to contact me.
When user clicks on one of the links in the navigation
the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When user clicks on the link to the section about my work
In the section about my work experiences I show
titled images of my previous web applications.
When the user hovers over the application image a larger image is shown.
When the user clicks on the images of the applications it takes him to the deployed web application where the user can test it.
When the user resizes the page or view the site on various screens and devices, he is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to his viewport.
